    "text": "Introduction\n\nChildhood\nGrowing up in Madison, Wisconsin has made me a peculiar person. Throughout my childhood, I was enrolled in Madison public schools which has laid a foundation for a variety of skills. Curiosity, problem solving, leadership, and compassion were all ingrained in me at a young age. Throughout high school I learned how to apply these skills through music and sports.I played clarinet in our school’s wind ensemble, but was also a 4 year captain of my golf team, and a standout player individually. Golf eventually led to Northern Michigan University, where I played 2 years of NCAA golf before deciding to focusing the entirety of my time at NMU into learning, asking questions, and exploring the discipline of ecology as a Fisheries and Wildlife Management Major.\n\n\nUniversity and Research\nWith a natural knack for asking questions and curiosity, I found myself looking everywhere to get involved in research. I am fortunate enough to have my father be heavily involved with medical research, which allowed me to become acquainted with the skills and work ethic needed for adequate data collection and analysis. This experience jump started my experience with ecological research that began with a volunteer lab assistant lab position for a graduate student (Ariel Edwards) through the NMU fish lab. I spent the next semester and a half running bomb calorimeter samples, with the ultimate goal of reconstructing the Lake Superior food web. During this same time period, I became acquainted with Randy Swaty and the Conservation Data Lab (CDL). This group had me diving head first into the world of GIS, forestry, modeling, and networking. What the experience with the CDL really sparked in me (no pun intended) was a love and fascination with fire ecology. This new found love has led me to find myself in California for two consecutive summers (’23 and ’24) working as a field technician and a forestry intern (more on these experiences in the “internships” tab).\n\n\nNow\nSince getting lost in the world of ecology, I have met some of the most fascinating people, and have explored both places and concepts I could only dream of. Currently, I am continuing my studies at NMU with plans to graduate in May 2025. I am actively involved in research in many facets. I am working for Dr. Sylvain Giroud’s energetics lab studying hibernation in thirteen-lined ground squirrels. I am also continuing my work with the CDL with modeling fire severity, risk, and other vegetation phenomena. I also am perfecting my experimental design and scientific studies skills with my plant ecology class. Outside of school and research, I am actively working as an NRCS forestry pathways intern, and an active officer for the NMU birding club(Northern Parulas).\n\n\nOnward\nMy plans for after graduation are loose and flexible, but not without a goal. I will be actively searching for a professor to advise a Masters and/or PhD project in fire ecology, forestry, or wildlife biology.During this intermediate period between undergrad and graduate school, I will likely work full time as a forester for the NRCS, but also gain experience in the field by obtaining wildland fire training, and whatever else comes my way."
